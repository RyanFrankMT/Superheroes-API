# BSCA Superheroes API

__About:__

This is the first Web-Dev class project for the Part-Time Summer of 2017 class. It is a fullstack application that utilizes MongoDB, Node, ExpressJS, Mongoose, and VueJS

__Project Notes:__

1. Can only run nodemon in the terminal when at the main folder (i.e.: Superheroes-API)
2. Watch for asynchronous functions.... they will execute and then keep going through the code and execute other things... so it might start executing A and then jump to B and then C and D before finishing A so it will look like: ABCDAEF... so A will be out of place for where it finishes
